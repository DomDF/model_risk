## Abstract:

The increasing availability of advanced computational modelling techniques offers new opportunities to improve safety, efficacy, and emissions reductions in engineering solutions. Application of complex models to support decisions in fields such as aerospace, energy, maritime, and structural engineering has been comparatively slow, in comparison to sectors outside of engineering, where there is a perception of lower risk, and therefore more scope for experimentation. 

Adopting a complex model introduces a \emph{model risk}, namely the expected consequence of incorrect or otherwise unhelpful outputs. This should be weighed against the prospective benefits that the more sophisticated model can provide, also accounting for the non-zero model risk of existing practice. Demonstrating when the model risk of a proposed machine learning application is As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) can help ensure that safety-critical industries benefit from complex models where appropriate while avoiding their misuse.

If the safety of physical infrastructure becomes tied to statistical models, then this model risk should also be within the scope of safety audits. Proposed in this paper is a quantitative, risk-based framework addressing: governance, verification, and mitigation strategies for prospective model deployment, drawing lessons from both the financial sector and engineering.
